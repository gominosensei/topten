topten
======

topten is a user script to block unwanted URLs from web pages.  It uses regular expressions to check the text in each anchor element in a document.  If the text matches a pattern, the link is replaced with a note saying that topten removed it.  

Thus far, I've only tested it with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">Tampermonkey</a> and Chrome on OS X and Windows 7.
